Results
	Unstable peak lifetime VS laser power
	Height VS laser power
	
	Jump freq and behaviour vs laser power Ge on Si
		Jump range, bright vs dark

Discussion
	Trend in avg lifetimes does not match between samples, also ratio amount differs. 
	
	Height of 1 step UP does not decrease linearly, thus implying different height appearances for UP

	jump freq: Appearance cycles are not periodic (fig 9A), nor the dark/bright ratio.
		average jump freq does go down with decreasing laser power!
